/*
Here comes the magic !

An android app is packaged and complied in an APK file.
This means that the original code cannot simply be read from the APK file.

So we added a complete copy of our project structure into this Assets folder.
Assets is usually a hierarchy of folders containing resources such as text or images.
In this case the resources are the java and xml files that created the app.

Obviously we could not put the Assets folder inside itself.
So this file is the end of the rainbow.
